# Inspiration
FlexAdvisor was inspired by our collective interest in fitness and the desire to provide users with week-long workout routines. The goal was to make exercise accessible and enjoyable for individuals with different fitness focuses, such as strength or weight-loss.

# What it does
FlexAdvisor is a Discord bot designed to provide week-long workout routines based on user preferences, focusing on either strength or weight-loss. 

# How we built it
FlexAdvisor was built using Discord.py for the Discord API integration and Python for the backend logic. Our intent is for the bot to feel user-friendly and make the routines easy to follow. 

# Challenges we ran into
During development, challenges included deciding how we wanted to incorporate the workout plans into our code. Ensuring a working discord bot that could function correctly and handle user inputs were a challenge for us as well.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team is proud of successfully implementing a functional Discord bot that caters to users interested but still new to fitness, or even long-time fitness enjoyers.

# What we learned
The development processed both introduced us to using Python for the first time for most of us, figuring out how to create a functional Discord bot, and using Discord API.

# What's next for FlexAdvisor Discord Bot
The future for FlexAdvisor involves expanding the bot's capabilities to offer a broader range of workout routines, incorporating feedback from users to enhance customization features, and exploring integrations with fitness tracking platforms for a more comprehensive user experience.
